### CPSC 120

* Lab 6- https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-06-christian-avi.git

    Lab 6 contained 2 parts, the first part was called Sandwich, in this part we had to take arguments from the terminal which were the ingredients for a sandwich, and output the sandwich which the arguments meant. This was interesting for me as we made use of arguments directly from the terminal and used them. Part 2 was about blackjack, here again, we used arguments from the terminal, which was a hand of cards in a blackjack game. The program interpreted these arguments and output the total or if they had busted. I liked the use of arguments from the terminal and it was interesting when learning how to use them. I also like this lab because this was the first game I made.

* Lab 7- https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-07-avi-ethan.git

   Lab 7 also contained 2 parts, the first part was about calculating the number of days between 2 dates using the Julian day formula. the program would take in the dates as arguments from the terminal and convert both of them to Julian day and then subtract the two dates to find the difference which was then output, this was interesting as we had to use large arithmetic equations to calculate the Julian days which gave rise to many syntax errors. The second part was about making a program that would show if parking was valid on some chosen streets, again arguments were taken from the terminals to determine the street, day, and time the user was asking for availability. using the information given the program determined whether parking for that particular instance was valid or not. This was interesting as this program was the first time I made a program relating directly to the real world and using real information. I liked that there was the use of real life information that made the program better to understand.

* Lab 9- https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-09-sam-avi.git

    Lab 9 also had 2 parts, the first part was about finding the average between test scores. The scores were taken from the terminal as arguments and put into a vector. This vector was then looped through to add up all the scores, Another loop was also used to determine the minimum and maximum numbers which were discarded from the total sum when calculating the average. This was interesting as this made use of vectors and the use of multiple loops to find the average. The second part was about comparing the schedule between 2 philosophers, the program would check if the schedules were conflicting with each other. The schedules were taken from the terminal as arguments and output if the schedule conflicted or not. This was interesting as it was the first time I discovered that strings could be used as vectors when comparing the 2 schedules and I liked the use of loops to compare the schedule which reduced the amount of code needed to write.
